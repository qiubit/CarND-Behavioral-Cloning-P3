Overview
---
This repository contains files for the Behavioral Cloning Project.

There are some slight differences between the specification and implementation:
- `model.py` and writeup is substituted with `CarND_Behavioral_Cloning_Model.ipynb`, which implements both model training and generation and documents reasoning between choices.
- `model.h5` is substituted with `resnet18.pth` (different format due to different framework used), available through https://drive.google.com/open?id=1CWtbt3bV-b8fn0VpTM9SdDvuG_inPxF4 due to the big size of the model.
- Video is available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZbKdfdOpfw&feature=youtu.be

The project uses fast.ai, as it is, in my opinion, the best modern deep learning framework for rapid prototyping.
